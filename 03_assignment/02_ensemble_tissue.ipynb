    "\n",
    "Using samples projected into the different latent spaces, use at least two ensemble approaches to predict their tissue of origin:\n",
    "One approach must use a learner/estimator that tends to overfit data.\n",
    "Another approach must use a weak learner that slightly outperforms a random estimator.\n",
    "Use a model evaluation strategy that allows you to play with different hyperparameters to select the best model, assess whether the models are good predictors across all tissues (take a look at the classification_reportLinks to an external site. function in sklearn) and whether they generalize well on unseen data."
